# TargetPractice
The TargetPractice program is a simple 2D shooter I made when learning Java. The player controls a green circle and can move horizontally and shoot upwards.
The goal of the game is to score 20 points from hitting targets that fly by overhead (red targets being worth 1 point and yellow targets being worth 2) without missing 10 shots.
